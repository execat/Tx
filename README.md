README
======
This static version of the website was made by me for the college technical festival.

Usage:
------
Host on your web server.

Modifications:
--------------
This is NOT the version that is uploaded. The on-site version (that might or might not exist right now at [Transmission](http://xaviertransmission.com) (I hope it isn't)) contains the following things that are not included in this commit:
* Too many (non-attributed, improper) images on the site. I prefer it this way.
* Removed blog folder because the only modification I made to it was the theme to match with the index.html theme (Flatpress installation)
* Uploading the minified as well as non-minified versions of the CSS and JS.
